While looking for an alternative for the Counterweight (AKA Key-Bak) I stumbled upon this Product

Make sure to choose the 1100G because it has better pulling force.
I've ordered one and it's much easier to mount, and also the tension strength is better AND much cheaper.
If you're sourcing parts for the Switchwire or converting your old machine, I'd highly recomend getting this instead.
