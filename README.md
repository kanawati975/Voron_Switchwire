## Features and Specifications of my VSW
My Switchwire is a conversion from Geeetech A30 Printer, which is almost identical to the 12V good old Creality CR-10, built with 2020 and 2040 Aluminum Extrusion Profiles. What makes it special is:
- Automated Remote Power Control (via Relays, controlled by the Raspberry Pi from the GUI)
- Dual linear Rails with four MGN12H Blocks on the Y Axis.
- Maximum print Volume: 305 x 305 x 350 mm.
- Controller Board BTT SKR-2 at 168MHz.
- Raspberry Pi 3B Rev 1.2
- TMC2130 Silent Drivers on all axis. 
- Galileo Extruder (Direct Drive).
- Volcano Hotend with 70W Heater Cartridge.
- 220VAC 750W 310x310 mm Silicone heated Bed (via SSR).
- 310 x 310 mm Heated Build Platform, with a magnetic Spring steel Sheet.
- Auto Bed (mesh) Probing... Well inslated Metal Detection Sensor/Z Probe.
- Filament Rounout Sensor.
- Hybrid Chamber Temperature Control (Passive Heating + Active Chamber Cooling + Chamber Temperature Sensor).
- Custom 3D Printed skirt, with dual 8015 silent Fans.
- External dual USB Ports for further connections to the Raspberry Pi.
- Dual Cameras (RaspiCam+USB Cam) for front **and** back view of the Print.
